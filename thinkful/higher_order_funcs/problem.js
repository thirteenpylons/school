Advanced functions: Higher-order functions
To complete this practice problem, you will write the functions according 
to the functions below. All of your functions should make use of the forEach() method.

This practice problem should take no more than 20 minutes. 
Make sure to ask for help if you need it!

[
  {
    type: "oak",
    height: "30m",
  },
  {
    type: "elm",
    height: "21m",
  },
];
Return value: none
Log the type property of each tree object to the console.

totalPoints()

Write a function totalPoints that uses forEach to add up an array of numbers.

Arguments: an array of numbers, like this:

[6, 7, 1, 3, 1, 17, 4, 12, 1, 5, 0, 13, 15];
Return value: the sum of the numbers in the array

buildSentence()

Write a function buildSentence that takes in an array of words and uses 
forEach to add the strings together. It should also add 
a space, " ", after each word .

["I'm", "looking", "for", "the", "man", "who", "shot", "my", "paw"];

logPercentages()

Write a function logPercentages that takes an array of decimal numbers 
and uses forEach to log each one with some formatting as shown below.

The numbers should be formatted as percentages. That means this:

Multiply by 100
Include the percent symbol% at the end of the string
Arguments: an array of numbers like this:

[0.75, 0.91, 0.48, 0.23, 0.99, 0.83, 1.1];
Return value: none

Use forEach and log each value using console.log.

The logged values should look like this:

75%
91%
48%
23%
99%
83%
110%
You may find it helpful to use template strings, but you don't have to.
