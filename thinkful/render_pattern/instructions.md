JSDOM: Render pattern
Instructions

You are helping your local bookstore build a shopping cart for their website. The list of books, prices, and quantities are stored in an array named books. For this challenge, you will create a few helper functions to display the cart, sort the books, and make small modifications to the cart.

Existing files

File path	Description
index.html	Contains the initial HTML page with placeholder elements. Your render() function will target these elements. You should not edit the HTML file in any way.
index.css	A few basic styles. This challenge does not focus on style. You may ignore this file.
index.js	You need to write your JavaScript code in this file. This is the only file that you need to edit.
test/render.test.js	The tests that your code will run against. You do not need to edit this file.
Tasks

The books array contains books in the following format:

{
  "title": "",
  "authors": ["", ""],
  "description": "",
  "price": 0,
  "rating": 5,
  "quantity": 1
}
Write the following functions in the index.js file.

renderBook()

This function accepts a book object in the format described above.
Create and return the HTML to render a single book. The HTML for a single book should look like this:

<div class="book">
  <div class="details">
    <div class="title">
      Elements of the Theory of Computation
      <span class="rating">(4.7 stars)</span>
    </div>
    <div class="authors">by Harry Lewis, Christos H. Papadimitriou</div>
    <div class="description">
      Algorithms, complexity analysis, and algorithmic ideas are introduced
      informally in Chapter 1, and are pursued throughout the book.
    </div>
    <button class="removeBtn">Remove from cart</button>
  </div>
  <div class="quantity">2 @ $182.65</div>
  <div class="price">$365.30</div>
</div>
hint: Use the template above to render the book information. E.g.

      <div class="title">
        ${title}
        <span class="rating">(${rating} stars)</span>
      </div>
calculateTotal()

Calculate and return the total price of all items in the cart. The function should return 0 when the cart is empty and should also consider the quantity for multiple items.

hint: Use the following code to calculate the total price: books.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr.quantity * curr.price, 0);

render()

This function is already implemented for you. Study the solution.

The books should be rendered in the section with ID cartItems. If there are no items in the cart, the text "Nothing in cart" should be inserted here instead.
The total should be rendered in the div with class total-price in the section with ID cartTotal. If there are no items in cart, the total should show "\$0".

sortByPrice()

Sort the books array by price in ascending order.

hint: sort the books and then render

  books.sort((a, b) => a.price - b.price);
  render();
Attach an event listener to the #sortBtn button that firsts sorts the array with the sortByPrice() function, then calls render().

main()

This function is already implemented for you. You only need to study it. This function performs all the startup tasks in the main function.
